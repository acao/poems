to have so much taken  
from you at such  
an age

the ringing of little bells  
to some, it sounded like a sweet song  
to you, a cacaphony of torment

"that was never love"  
you've said  
what were you trained to  
believe about masculinity,  
power & love, then?

what are you trying to forget?

the edges are raw & tender  
the moment you begin to feel them,  
the moment you sense the tickling of pain  
you take flight like a frightened bird  
it's better than freezing to death

there are thousands and thousands  
of ways around this  
but maybe cutting right through it  
breaking up the raw earth,   
smelling the blood in that soil  
will never make a path towards your healing

can you imagine  
all the ways you've learned to love  
emerging from that frightened wilderness  
where all your fellow birds take flight  
not from a sense of fear  
but from the fires of self determination?

can you see, how gracefully you've found it in yourself  
to heal inwardly & make space for those you hold dear?

I will stop asking all of these questions  
now that I know that  
the love you show  
holds all the answers

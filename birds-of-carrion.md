My silent soaring is the sound of your death  
Sometimes you humans fear I will descend from the sky  
But I’m guessing you are merely afraid  
That I am calmly calculating your end

I’ve flown over these hills and valleys  
For more than half a century  
I’ve seen you skipping rocks on the gravel bar  
Swinging from wild grape vines into the river  
On hot summer days, singing and laughing  
Kissing your first love  
With such soulful tenderness  
Carrying your son through the forest  
His young eyes wild with wonder

Maybe some day I will know your flesh  
Me and my brothers and sisters will dine on your sacrament  
And we will feast on all the love and beauty that is your life

I’ve learned to embrace the unknown  
Some day I may return to my nest destroyed, in tatters  
But we can always build another

I have taught my children  
Which of your hens are growing old  
And that you leave me gifts from your hunting trips  
In that glade where the wild irises grow

Some day they will know your death  
Just as I have known your life

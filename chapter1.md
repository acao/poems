For us both,  
the odds have been so unprecedented  
but the innumerable ways  
we've found to nurture  
and heal the human soul  
all that we've found within ourselves  
beings teeming with life  
  
forgetting to be human  
discovering divinity,  
for that moment  
you're holding up the crown we are  
holding it together  
  
the weights are lifted, for that moment  
we are both in our being and aware  
letting the light through, boldly  
aware that the world was passing by or still  
or forgiving  
  
deeply touched by humility & boldness  
we were unafraid to let go  
so that some day we may  
find each other once again from  
opposite ends of this forest  
  
& I know that  
I'd sooner catch fire  
& float away on the embers  
than forget the  
sweet sound of  
your name

sometimes we tend to stray into ways  
where the cutting back of meadows & forests  
turns asunder the medicine that they want to give us  
they know us for our pain,  
our anger, our inflammation, our fear  
they know us for our bodies bristling  
with a love we are forgetting  
  
the yarrow wants to mend our wounds &  
help us define our boundaries  
  
there are the nettles who fill our   
blood & bones with laughter & life  
  
all the healing we try to keep away,  
at the edges,  
an unkempt wilderness of feeling  
that still finds it way within our  
manicured terrain  
  
the artemesia, in its youthful & silvery clasp  
off in some lot dancing about our dreams  
- or the plaintain leaves, bristling between our  
toes with a gentle healing & also  
memories of colonization,   
of the blood that lines these trails  
  
we wonder, why is there such an effort to keep it back  
what might we be missing if their medicine  
grew to our very doorsteps, to embrace the tangibility of our lives  
their fragile leaves opening   
new windows to let in the air  
to better ease our fragile coping   
into a place of healing  
letting in all the light we need  
to feel clearly & fearlessly

I used to wonder where that spirit came from

To fight like hell for the living

I still can feel the warmth from your fiery soul of compassion

I can taste your chicken dumplings, your laurel teas

Whisky sours and rainy evenings with Ray Charles on the turntable



We came into the world with your blessings

Though we could never see your smile, or hear your laughter



Wherever you found yourself you always strived to

Create a home for you and your daughters

There would always be cherry blossoms, blueberry brambles

The Meremac river drifting somewhere nearby



Trips to the farm, the kids running through the fields

Splashing about in Brazil creek, playing games in the melon patches

Echos of laughter in the shimmering autumnal sun

Heartfelt memories and photos of your dearly beloved, gone away



Paula & Gail fought uphill to raise their siblings

Taking care of the roast while you were at work

Making eachother lunch for school while you toiled away

Fighting for them and yourself, to wreak a living from a world

Who would rather have you resigned to your fate



Lillian: I want you to know that your spirit is more real for me than it ever has been before

I see you in the tired eyes of every working mother

In the eyes of every woman who refuses to surrender to suffering

Who fights to overcome pain and transform the world around her



You taught me that caring for others is much like caring for myself

That we won't get anywhere if we can't get there together

That family - like love - transcends blood, time and the corporeal



Every morning that I feel myself trapped in the maws of suffering

You lift me out with grace and humility

You show me my soul is burning, too, and how we can use

That fire to make our escape



On the other side, there are fields of lilacs, lillies and laurel trees



Only to sweetness will I ever surrender

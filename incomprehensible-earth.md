On the other side of the kindom

the racheting of moths can be heard

the thick, flattering roar of a million cicadas

filling the opaque sky with their webs and wings



drowning in silt or sand,

dense handfulls of the incomprehensible earth

our love of forests has

marked our divine communion



we were warnd this day would come

the goldenseal has been waiting for it

senses heightened, awarenesses acute

ready for whatever floods 

or storms are to come its way

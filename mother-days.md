  
I was light of step  
now I am heavy hearted  
All the lights were on in the house and there  
was nowhere to go  
no-one to be found  
the phones all went unanswered  
Opa’s house, friends houses, dad’s office  
& all that answered was  
the gaping, gnawing fear of the morbid unknown

I am imagining you in a gurney  
I am imagining you hooked up to inexplicable machines  
hopefully keeping you alive  
long brightly lit sterile hallways  
people in coats methodically counting   
out loud how many minutes you had left

You were always so fearless  
Even as you lost all of your hair  
Even as you were sick & weary from the medicine

I flashed back to that one afternoon  
When I saw ounces blood splattered on the carpet  
And I later found out you had cut part of your finger off  
With the clippers while gathering roses

This house is feeling small  
All the lights are still on and  
I’d better make some food   
in case my brother comes home   
hungry and afraid like me

I have my paper route in the morning  
All I can do is scream and cry  
and wail for your dear life, for a sign  
of your survival

Maybe thats how you’d feel when  
They wouldn’t tell you if I was alive or dead  
for hours

Maybe thats how you felt when you drove for  
dozens of hours a week up I-44  
between jobs & school  
hoping your mother would still be alive when you got there  
hoping she wouldn’t die alone  
hoping you could catch a wink on the   
waiting room couch for just a bit longer this time

When I think of mothers day  
I think about survival  
How blessed I am that I  
Can still hear your voice

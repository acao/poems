sometimes i wake in fear   
to the sound of anguished cries   
to the bleating of war drums and the   
rumble and thud of bombs   

i awake already sobbing  
our tears, all running together,  
tiny rivulets in the mud until they reach  
that place where fires,  
debris and strongly held opinions  
stand stoically like the hoover dam  
a counter-insurgency against  
the natural course of our suffering  

the resounding roar of empire  
mangy hawks across the way shrieking where  
a brittle statue of a dull and angry man  
rears it's ugly head each morning  

sometimes i wake to this abhorrent cacaphony  
and then i feel powerless  

everyone is saying that they are waging these wars  
for freedom  
while all our lives and dreams are crushed every moment  

will someone ask that man  
on the tv with strong opinions and facts  
about people he's never met  
if he, in his infinite wisdom, knows  
how many more bombs it will take until  
the seething violence of humanity  
cracks open the  
forlorn and solemn soul of the earth?

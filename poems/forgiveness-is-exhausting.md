sometimes it's not fair  
to yourself to force yourself to learn to forgive  
when there are no end to the flashbacks  
when they aren't willing to be vulnerable, or even  
reconcile  
when you are still tangled up in the  
threads of your own undoing  
  
forgiveness may not be the thread that  
will untangle the mess, in fact  
it may be the one that tightens it  
  
the toil of understanding why  
they chose to hurt you  
of being compassionate towards  
their own suffering  
  
it can be transformational  
or it can be exhausting  
  
just don't forget to let yourself off  
the hook first  
  
no one deserves to be forced to   
anticipate their own impeding death  
arent you incredible for surviving it?  
  
dont forget to give yourself shelther from the rain  
and to give the light a chance to come through

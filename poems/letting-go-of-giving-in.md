*CW Self Harm, Suicide*  

In the mental hospital they nicknamed me jesus  
not just because I'd been  
 pink slipped there from metro ER   
without a hair tie, whisked away to some place in beechwood   
my rosy golden locks still shimmering but my whole life a mess   
visions of my own possible fate still melting away in my mind   
one podmate said they called me Jesus because I gave them hope   
we all did though   
what can we do with 10 minutes with a psych   
spinning the meds wheel, gambling with our minds   
something so critical done so hastily and carelessly   
we became our own support system   
volunteered as eachother's group therapists,   
counselors, social workers & priests   
my one comrade in her "atypical" messianic   
wisdom of gods light & the angels among us   
or my boston bud with his view from the street   
brimming with trauma and hope   
raunchy raucous humor and a tender heart   
despite the vicious cycle, solidarity found no bounds   
despite our bandaged wrists & manic ideations and   
stomachs pumped   
it was there that we promised each other   
that we would teach each other to practice the art of   
letting go of giving in   
even when it took immense courage   
to stay alive in this world, in our minds   
that we would always despite the struggle   
make a goal to see the ones we   
love tomorrow   
and the next day   
and still embrace our own mortality   
and never again scramble to find a way   
to cause it   
I still haven't found a therapist or a med   
that works but those many   
moments we shared in pain or healing   
still gives me so much hope & motivation   
that I can find a way to some day look   
myself in the mirror with all the same   
love and humble repsect that I once had   
that i can draw those I love near without   
destroying what we have   
so tenderly & trustfully built together   
not many of us have had the same blessings I've had   
a family at all, let alone one that can still   
love them without stigma and look them in the eye   
or the resources to climb out from   
the death wheel of capitalism   
but our promises stay true   
we are all still alive by choice   
some of us have found honest and true love, or re-found it   
or at least more strength to live than before   
a few more reasons to not be ashamed of   
or afraid of being openly our honest,   
authentic, hoodest and/or blackest and/or queerest selves   
no one needs to remind us that   
there is NO ONE that  
can define our manhood, womanhood or anyhood  
and many of us still thrive in the prayers and praxis that we  
will some day wake up in a dream world where   
no institutions or poisined minds   
can take away our autonomy   
that abuse or addicition can only only need rule our lives temporarily if   
we can remember where to find   
the escape hatch deep within
